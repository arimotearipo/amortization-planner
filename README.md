# Amortization Planner

Amortization Planner is a web-based tool that helps users plan and visualize their loan amortization schedules. If you are planning to get a mortgage, use this tool to get a glimpse on how you can amortize faster.

## Features

- **Interactive Loan Calculator:** Enter principal, interest rate, term, investment return and extra payments to generate a custom amortization schedule.
- **Extra Payment Input:** Enter how you want to fork out extra money to make your amortization go faster -- or use that money to invest!
- **Amortization Table:** View a month-by-month breakdown of principal, interest, and remaining balance.
- **Split Slider:** Use the slider to adjust how paying extra towards investment or principal can affect how fast you amortize!
- **Visual Charts:** Graphical representation of payment breakdown and loan payoff progress (planned feature).
- **Modern UI:** Built with Next.js and styled for a clean, user-friendly experience.
